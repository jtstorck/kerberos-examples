## [ugi-test](https://github.com/jtstorck/ugi-test)
The ugi-test project was moved to a separate repository, [ugi-test](https://github.com/jtstorck/ugi-test), and added as a submodule to this repository.  Depending on how much I like working with submodules, it might be kept this way, converted to a subtree, or reverted back to a subdirectory.  For now, I'll keep the submodule in this repository's master branch to the latest commit in [ugi-test](https://github.com/jtstorck/ugi-test).
